# Tetris Game Machine Learning

A classic Tetris implementation built using Claude Code with as little prompting details as possible using Python and Pygame, featuring all standard gameplay mechanics. Machine learning is used to let AI play the game. The code was written using two very minimal prompts lacking detailed info (purposely so)

**prompt 1**) Build a game of tetris in python with pygame. Ensure that the controls are in a seperate file, so that has actions like left, right, down, etc. Just like tetris, with 7 tetrimino types

**prompt 2**) I want AI to play Tetris now. Use the existing code, but change the controls to AI. It needs to learn to play tetris and the attached images describe the two features to use. I want the user to be able to tweak the values from -10 to 10 to find the optimal penalty/reward values

Notice I did not specify any details about what kind of machine learning to use
